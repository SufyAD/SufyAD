# 👋 Hi, I’m Sufyan

I’m a **Hardware Design & Verification Engineer** with hands-on experience in **RTL design, cache architectures, AXI-based systems, and RISC-V cores**.  
I work close to the microarchitecture, focusing on **correctness, performance, and protocol-compliant hardware design**.

I enjoy solving problems where **design intent, RTL behavior, and verification rigor intersect**.

## 🛠 What I Do

- RTL design and verification using **SystemVerilog**
- Microarchitecture work on **cache subsystems and memory hierarchies**
- Design and verification of **AXI / AMBA-based interfaces**
- Implementation and validation of **atomic operations (LR/SC, AMOs)**
- Block-level and subsystem-level **functional verification**
- Writing clear and structured **technical documentation**
- Debugging corner cases related to **ordering, alignment, and coherency**

## 🚀 Projects I’ve Worked On

### 🔹 Level-2 (L2) Cache
- Designed and verified L2 cache behavior for **loads, stores, fills, and evictions**
- Worked with **1024-bit wide datapaths**, misaligned accesses, and strobe/data alignment
- Implemented and verified arbitration and MSHR interactions
- Documented cache behavior and interaction with **L1 caches and Tile Memory**
- Verified cacheable vs non-cacheable access flows under randomized stress

### 🔹 RISC-V Core (Ariane)
- Verification and testing of a **RISC-V scalar core**
- Worked on memory access paths, privilege behavior, and pipeline interactions
- Assisted in system-level validation with cache and memory subsystems

### 🔹 Atomic Operations (AMO / LR-SC)
- Implemented and verified **AXI atomic operations**
- Modified FSM logic and removed dependency on reservation tables
- Ensured correctness under contention and concurrent master scenarios

### 🔹 SoC Integration
- Replaced a **32-bit boot processor with a 64-bit Scalar Unit**
- Enabled **Linux boot**, MMU, and cache support
- Integrated with **UDMA, CLINT, and PLIC**
- Produced analysis and design documentation for integration readiness

> Good hardware is not just about passing tests — it’s about **clear intent, clean RTL, and predictable behavior under stress**.
